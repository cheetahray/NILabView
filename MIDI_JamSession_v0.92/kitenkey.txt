kitenkey.zip contains two MIDI files for "Kitten on the Keys" by Zez Confrey,
and sequenced by John E. Roache. This is a great piece written in 1921
during the ragtime era, and is an excellent illustration of the "stride"
piano style.

Unpack the .zip file for the MIDI files, and also read about the piece.
